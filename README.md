# InternetHealthTest
This is a python script that pings Google every 5 seconds and keeps a log of any internet outages lasting longer than 20 seconds.
It also sends a crap ton of notifications, just in case you weren't painfully aware of your internet going down.

## Installation
1. Make sure you're running Python 3.7 with pip and Tkinter installed.
2. Once you've done that, install win10toast with ```pip install win10toast```.
4. That should be it!
